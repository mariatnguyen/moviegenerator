# Movie Generator

A movie generator app that suggests a movie to watch based on parameters using The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

First Draft:

Currently a work in progress... The goal is to: 
- Add an "All" genre
- Fix date to a January 1, 2020 format
- Initialize web page with scattered posters; it is currently plain
- Add animations to menu
- Add more customizable parameters other than genre (year and/or rating)
- Add an error message if can't find a movie
- Random movie suggestions seems to scroll through the same few movies... not sure if this is because of API running through only 1 page of the array or something else
